# Project-Euler-Solutions
My solutions to various project Euler problems.

As of 8/31/2017, all of the solutions in this repository are in Haskell. Unless otherwise specified in the Solution.hs file, if you would like to test my work, you will need GHCI -- or some equivalent -- installed on your machine. Feel free to open up issues or make pull requests if you notice inefficiencies or the like.
