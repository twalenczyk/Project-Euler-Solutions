# Project-Euler-Solutions
My solutions to various project Euler problems. If you haven't done the problem yourself, don't look at the code! You'll ruin all the fun for yourself.

To run the Haskell solutions, you will need GHCI -- or some equivalent -- installed on your machine. Feel free to open up issues or make pull requests if you notice inefficiencies or the like.
